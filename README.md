## 👋 Hi, I’m @sabian4695
### I am an engineer who dabbles in too many things. 
### My main work is for [VBA Decoded](https://github.com/vbadecoded). I created this as the modern VBA/Access resource I wish I had.

#### Otherwise - I enjoy building websites and have a few I contribute to. 
#### I also love building hardware and running it on Arduino, so you'll see some C++.

#### 📫 email me at jbrow4@gmail.com
